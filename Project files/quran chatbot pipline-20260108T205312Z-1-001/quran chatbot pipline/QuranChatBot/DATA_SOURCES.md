# Data Sources and Licensing

This repository ships with two JSON files in the `metadata/` directory:

* **`ayahs_collection.json`** – Contains the Arabic text of each ayah, transliteration, multiple
  translations (English, Urdu, Farsi, Pashto) and a tafsir snippet.  
  These data were aggregated from open source projects such as Tanzeel and
  [**Quran Encodings and Translations**](https://tanzil.net/) as of the time this project was created.

* **`words_collection.json`** – Contains tokenised word information for each ayah, including root and lemma
  tags and glosses in multiple languages.  
  This dataset was assembled from publicly available lexical resources.

The content of these datasets remains the property of their original authors.  
If you plan to distribute or deploy this project beyond personal or research use, please verify
that your use of these datasets complies with their respective licences and provide proper
attribution.  
See the Tanzeel website and accompanying licences for more information.

If you replace or augment these files with other translations or tafsir, document the source and
licensing terms here before distributing your changes.
